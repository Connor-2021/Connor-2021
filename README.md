I am currently learning AWS through the Re-Start Program at techTalent Academy, this is allowing me increase my skills and knowledge around computing and the different aspects to computing and to be a qualified AWS Cloud Practioner. 

I also stream games in my free time when I am not working or training,I stream on platforms like Facebook Gaming and I have just started streaming on Twitch, to allow me to gain a bigger audience. I am also always on the lookout to better my PC and upgrade the different components of the computer my most recent upgrade is the CPU and Processor.
